# Introduction

This documentation describes the Lua kernel modules that are available in NFLua.

# Netfilter Callbacks

## Match callback function

```
function match(pkt)
	return true
end
```

The match callback receives one [packet object](#packet) `pkt` representing a Linux `sk_buff`.
After the callback returns no further operations can be performed on the packet.
This callback should return either a boolean to indicate whether it's a match, or `"hotdrop"` to indicate hotdropping the packet; other return values are considered an error.
In case of errors, it is considered that the match function returned false.
For information on how to register a match callback see the `nflua/iptables/README.md` documentation.

## Target callback function

```
function target(pkt)
	return 'drop'
end
```

The target callback receives one [packet object](#packet) `pkt` representing a Linux sk_buff.
After the callback returns no further operations can be performed on the packet unless it returned `'stolen'`.
This callback should return one of the following strings: `'drop'`, `'accept'`, `'stolen'`, `'queue'`, `'repeat'` and `'stop'`.
Returning any other value will have the same effect as `XT_CONTINUE`.
For information on how to register a target callback see the `nflua/iptables/README.md` documentation.

# Modules

## Netlink

### `size = netlink.send(port, groups, payload)`

Sends a Netlink datagram using protocol defined by kernel symbol `NETLINK_NFLUA`.
The datagram is sent to port with ID given by number `port` and to multicast groups given by the bits on number `groups`.
The contents of the datagram is given by the parameter `payload`, which can be either a string or a [memory](https://github.com/cujoai/lua-memory/) object.

## Timer

### `timer = timer.create(msecs, callback)`

Return a new timer that will call the function `callback` once after `msecs` milliseconds.

### `timer.destroy(timer)`

If `timer` was never triggered, it is cancelled so its callback will not be called.
Otherwise, this function has no effect.

## Conntrack

### `id = conn.find(family, protocol, srcaddr, srcport, dstaddr, dstport)`

Returns an intenger that represents the ID of the connection specified, similar to [`packet:connid`](#id--packetconnid).
Returns nil and an error message if it can't find the connection ID.

`family` is either 4 or 6.
`protocol` is either `'tcp'` or `'udp'`.
`srcaddr` and `dstaddr` are the dotted-notation strings representing the IP addresses.
`srcport` and `dstport` are integers representing the transport layer ports.

Contrary to connections passing through the INPUT and OUTPUT chains, the ones passing through FORWARD chain will have distinct pairs of source and destination address.

The following example illustrates a scenario where a connection passing through FORWARD with distinct address information for each direction.

```

|                                                                    |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
            |                                            |
            |                                            |
            |                                            |
            |                                            |
            |                                            |
            |                                            |
            |                                            |
            |                                            |
            |                                            |
  +-------------------+                         +-------------------+
  |      device       |                         |     internet      |

  +-------------------+                         +-------------------+

```

In such case, the output of the command `conntrack -L` should be:

```
# conntrack -L
  ipv4     2 udp      17 0 src=192.168.1.100 dst=8.8.8.8 sport=8080 dport=22 packets=1 bytes=76 src=8.8.8.8 dst=10.0.0.38 sport=22 dport=8080 packets=1 bytes=76 mark=0 use=2
```

Moreover, the code below illustrates the result of `traffic` in such case.

```lua
local p1, b1 = nf.traffic(4, "udp", "192.168.1.100", 8080, "8.8.8.8", 22, 'original')
local p2, b2 = nf.traffic(4, "udp", "10.0.0.38", 8080, "8.8.8.8", 22, 'original')
local p3, b3 = nf.traffic(4, "udp", "8.8.8.8", 22, "10.0.0.38", 8080, 'reply')
local p4, b4 = nf.traffic(4, "udp", "8.8.8.8", 22, "192.168.1.100", 8080, 'reply')

assert(p1 == p3)
assert(b1 == b3)
assert(p2 == nil)
assert(p4 == nil)
```

### `packets, bytes [, packets, bytes] = conn.traffic(family, protocol, srcaddr, srcport, dstaddr, dstport, dir)`

Returns the numbers of packets and the number of bytes of a given connection.

The parameters `family`, `protocol`, `srcaddr`, `dstaddr`, `srcport` and `dstport` are the same as in [`conn.find`](#id--connfindfamily-protocol-srcaddr-srcport-dstaddr-dstport).
The parameter `dir` should be either `"original"`, `"reply"` or `"both"`.
In case of `"both"` returns 4 values corresponding to the counters of the directions `"original"` and `"reply"` respectively.

## Packet

### `packet:close()`

Discards all resources of the packet; this function can only be called on packets that have been stolen.
After this call no further operations can be performed on the packet.
Returns true on success.

### `id = packet:connid()`

Returns an integer that represents the ID of the packet's connection as maintained by `conntrack` module of Netfilter.
This `id` might be reused by other future connections, but such reuse indicates that all previous connections identified by the same value are not tracked anymore.

### `mem = packet:frame()`

Returns a [memory](https://github.com/cujoai/lua-memory/) object which references the frame part of the packet (L1 header).
When the packet is closed the memory object becomes empty and stop referencing the packet.

### `packet:send([payload])`

Send the packet through the network and then closes it, thus it cannot be sent again.
If `payload` is provided, the original packet payload is replaced by the contents of string `payload`.
This function only works after you steal the packet in the FORWARD chain.

### `packet:tcpreply(type, message)`

Sends a TCP reply with the string `message` as payload.
To this function work two conditions must be met:

- The original packet must be intercepted in the FORWARD chain.
- The address of the recipient of the reply packet must be in the same subnet of the interface that the original packet was intercepted.

### `... = packet:unpack(fmt [, pos])`

Returns the values encoded in position `pos` of packet's payload (see diagram below), according to the format `fmt` (see the [Lua manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.4.2)).
Formats `f`, `d` are not supported.
The default value for `pos` is 1.

```
+-----------------------------------------+
|packet header||      packet payload      |
+-----------------------------------------+
+-----------------------------------------+
|             ||      |       |           |
|  Ethernet   ||  IP  |  TCP  |    ...    |
|             ||      |       |           |
+---------------------+-------+-----------+
```

### `packet:copybytes(m [, i [, j [, o]]])`

Copies as much of the contents of packet's payload from position `i` until `j` to memory `m` from position `o` of `m`;
i, j and o can be negative.

These indices are corrected following the same rules of function [`memory.find`](https://github.com/cujoai/lua-memory/blob/master/doc/manual.md#memoryfind-m-s--i--j--o).
